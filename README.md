# miro_board_creator
Generates a new miro board with a temp mail adress for you use

Miro free version is limited to only one team that belongs to you. And every board you open within that team has to be shared with everyone that has been added to that team. This makes it hard to have private pages. And the page limit within the team restricts you from opening more than 5 pages.

This tool when complete will enable you to create a board whenever you desire. And as you will have seperate teams access will be restricted to people who only have the team join link.
