##What does it do?
Generates a new miro board with a temp mail adress for you to use in your creative endeavors. At the end the team invite link is copied to your clipboard.

##Why do you need it?
[Free version of miro](https://miro.com/pricing/) is limited to only one team that belongs to you. And every board you open within that team has to be shared with everyone that has been added to that team. This makes it hard to have private pages. Also the page limit within the team restricts you from opening more than 3 editable boards.
This tool enables you to create a board whenever you desire. And as you will have seperate teams access will be restricted to people who only have the team invite link.
